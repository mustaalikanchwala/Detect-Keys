# Detect-Keys
**Detect Keys** is a JavaScript project that captures and displays key presses in real-time. Using HTML to structure a table and CSS for styling, it listens to `keydown` events and shows the key, key code, and key name instantly on screen. Great for learning about events and DOM manipulation.
